# Linux Process and Job Control Workshop Prioritization

This workshop outline prioritizes **Job Control** as the most critical foundational skill, followed by **Core Monitoring** and **Termination**.

***

## Priority 1: Core Job Control, Monitoring, and Termination ðŸ¥‡

These are the essential, most frequently used concepts for controlling tasks within a shell session and managing system processes.

| Concept | Commands/Tools | Key Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Job Control** | `&`, `ctrl-z`, `fg`, `bg`, `jobs` | How to manage processes **within a shell session** (foreground/background, suspending). This is fundamental CLI efficiency. |
| **Process Snapshot** | `ps -ef`, `ps aux` | Learn to **identify** processes, their owners, PIDs, and basic resource usage at a **moment in time**. |
| **Real-time Monitoring** | `htop` (recommended) | Learn to **observe** system status (CPU, Memory, Load Average) and quickly **sort/filter** resource-intensive processes in real-time. |
| **Process Termination** | `kill PID`, Signals (`-15` / SIGTERM, `-9` / SIGKILL) | Understand the difference between a **graceful exit** (`SIGTERM`) and a **forceful termination** (`SIGKILL`). Connect `ctrl-c` to the `SIGINT` signal. |

## Priority 2: Resource Management & Advanced Diagnostics ðŸ¥ˆ

These elements build upon the core concepts, providing deeper control and specialized monitoring for diagnosing performance issues.

| Concept | Commands/Tools | Key Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Load Simulation & Impact** | `siege`, `htop` | **Hands-on Demonstration:** Use a load tool like `siege` to show the real-time impact on **Load Average**, CPU, and Memory metrics visible in `htop`. |
| **Process Prioritization** | `nice`, `renice` | How to modify a process's **niceness value** (priority) to manage resource contention, ensuring background or non-critical tasks run without slowing the system. |
| **Network Diagnostics** | `iftop` | A specialized tool to diagnose processes that are consuming excessive **network traffic** (volume, source/destination) as an alternative to CPU/Memory bottlenecks. |

## Recommended Workshop Flow

1.  **Job Control:** Start with practical skills (`fg`, `bg`, `ctrl-z`) for immediate productivity.
2.  **Process Overview:** Use **`ps`** to understand system context (PIDs, Users) outside the current shell.
3.  **Real-time & Control:** Use **`htop`** to monitor, then practice **`kill`**ing processes using different signals.
4.  **Resource Management:** Explain **`nice`** to manage task priority.
5.  **Hands-on Walkthrough:** Simulate load with **`siege`**, use **`htop`** and **`iftop`** to diagnose the issue, and finally, use **`kill`** to terminate the load.
