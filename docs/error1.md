### Failure to configure keybased authentication correctly 

The most common error is generating the key pair on the wrong computer. To avoid this, **you must carefully check the prompt** to ensure that you run the ssh-keygen and ssh-copy-id commands on your local system.

Assume that you are the user john and you want to set up key-based authentication for logging in to a server whose DNS name is remoteserver.example.com. Your instructor has created the account johnsr for you on that server. To configure key-based authentication for passwordless login, you may use any of the following local environments: `Windows CMD`, `Windows WSL`, `macOS Terminal`, `Alpine Linux`, or even a `Debian virtual machine`. **The critical requirement is to check the prompt** so that you always know which computer you are issuing commands on.  

 **Correct procedure:**

> In Linux, the shell prompt is typically shown as `user@hostname:~$ `. Administrators often set the hostname to the first part of the domain name. For example, on our example the remote prompt might appear as **`johnsr@remoteserver:~$ `**.  
NOT e.g `johnsr@remoteserver.example.com:~$ `
> The local prompt, depending on the environment and the user account that John is using, could be, for example, one of the following: `C:\Users\john>`, `alpine:~$`, `john@mywsl`, `john@debian`, `student@debian`, `john@MacBook-Pro ~ %`."
