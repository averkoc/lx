### Linux Essentials – Pages related to workshop instruction videos  

The links to individual workshop pages are provided in the LMS. These GitHub pages are not meant to be complete instructions on their own.  
They serve as partial outlines to accompany the videos and as a resource for you to copy code blocks or access linked files while working.  

To get the most out of each workshop, make sure to watch the video while completing the activities. This way you will learn more effectively, and your submission is more likely to succeed on the first attempt — saving both your time and mine.
