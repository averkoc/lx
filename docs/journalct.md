# journalctl Command Reference

## Common journalctl Commands

| Purpose | Command | Explanation |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| View all logs (entire systemd journal) | `journalctl` | Shows all messages since the journal started (might be very large). |
| View current boot logs | `journalctl -b` | Restricts logs to the current boot only. |
| View previous boot logs | `journalctl -b -1` | Shows logs from the last boot. |
| View Apache2-related log messages | `journalctl -u apache2` | Filters logs for the Apache2 systemd service unit. |
| Continuously follow Apache2 logs | `journalctl -u apache2 -f` | Works like `tail -f` for Apache logs. |
| Show logs from today | `journalctl --since today` | Starts output at the beginning of the current day. |
| Show logs for a specific time range | `journalctl --since "2025-10-01 00:00:00" --until "2025-10-06 23:59:59"` | Filters logs by date and time. |
| Show who used sudo | `journalctl _COMM=sudo` | Filters by command name (`sudo` executions). |
| Show sudo commands executed (affected files) | `journalctl _COMM=sudo | grep -E "COMMAND="` | Displays sudo commands executed, useful to see which files were targeted. |
| View logs for a specific user (UID 1000) | `journalctl _UID=1000` | Shows logs generated by processes of that user. |
| View logs for a specific process (PID 1234) | `journalctl _PID=1234` | Shows messages only from that process ID. |
| View kernel logs only | `journalctl -k` | Displays kernel messages (like `dmesg`). |
| Show most recent 50 logs | `journalctl -n 50` | Works like `tail -n`. |
| Follow logs in real time | `journalctl -f` | Streams logs as they are written. |
| Show failed systemd services (errors this boot) | `journalctl -p err -b` | Filters logs at error priority for current boot. |
| View logs for SSH login attempts | `journalctl -u ssh` or `journalctl _COMM=sshd` | Helpful to investigate login attempts or brute force. |

## Useful One-Liners

| Purpose | Command | Explanation |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Count number of sudo uses | `journalctl _COMM=sudo | grep -c "COMMAND="` | Shows how many sudo commands were run. |
| Find top 10 most recent sudo commands | `journalctl _COMM=sudo | grep "COMMAND=" | tail -n 10` | Displays the last 10 sudo commands executed. |
| Show logs with a specific keyword | `journalctl | grep "error"` | Searches logs for the word "error". |
| View logs for a specific unit with paging | `journalctl -u apache2 | less` | Easier navigation with `less`. |
| Show logs with priority levels (warning or higher) | `journalctl -p warning` | Filters logs by severity (warning, error, critical, alert, emergency). |
| Follow logs but only show errors | `journalctl -f -p err` | Real-time error stream. |
| Show boot times (list all boots) | `journalctl --list-boots` | Helpful to pick which boot ID to investigate. |
| Show logs from 30 minutes ago | `journalctl --since "30 min ago"` | Filters logs starting 30 minutes back. |
| Export logs to a file | `journalctl > full_journal.log` | Saves all logs to a file for offline analysis. |
| Export only Apache2 logs to a file | `journalctl -u apache2 > apache2.log` | Saves service-specific logs. |
