## Testing your workshop (pilot)

The workshops are supported by complete recorded video instructions and accompanying GitHub support pages, which together contain also the model reports (screenshots).
As additional support, I have created a test program to help you identify potential issues before submitting your report. This provides immediate feedback and
allows you to correct problems while the workshop is still fresh in your memory. 

### How to get started with the test program
