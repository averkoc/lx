## Build the environment for Linux workshops   
### Overview

If you are a Windows user, you will use VirtualBox virtualization software to build a configuration consisting of three computers: a Windows PC, a Debian Linux server virtual machine, and an Alpine Linux desktop virtual machine. I have prepared ready-to-use virtual machines that you only need to download and import to set up the configuration.

If you are a Mac user, you will use UTM virtualization software to build a configuration consisting of two computers: your Mac and a Debian Linux server virtual machine. You will need to perform the Debian installation yourself with the help of my recorded instructions.

Before you start, read [virtualization]({{ "/virtualization/" | relative_url }})
 to get an idea what can be achieved by virtualization.  

### Configuring the server VM 
The recording contains instructions for the activities you need to do in the server after setting up the configuration. They include etc. 
* verify that your server can acces Internet and it can be reached by the host-computer (PC/Mac)
* ensure that the system is up-to-date
* add a personal account using your firstname as the account-name.
* give admin rights to your personal account
* modify the web-server index.html page to contain your account name.
* install workshop test program that you will use to test your
  


### Reporting  
You will report the completion of the workshop **by pasting a screenshot directly to LMS answerbox** that demonstrates connectivity between the required systems.

The screenshot must show a scenario in which you have connected:
- From your **host computer** to the **Debian server VM** using a web browser, and  
- From the **Alpine Desktop Linux VM** to the **Debian server VM** using a web browser (Windows users only).
- Part of your Windows/Mac desktop background must be visible in the screenshot.
