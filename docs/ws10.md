## Scripting - this page supports the related video
### Motivation for Learning 
Scripting is a powerful way to turn repetitive tasks into reliable, repeatable workflows: system administrators use scripts for backups, user and service management, and monitoring; developers and analysts automate builds, tests, and data preparation; and power users speed up everyday tasks. That power comes with risk — a script run with administrative rights can change or destroy large parts of a system in seconds, so always review and test scripts, especially those using sudo, even when working on a system used only by you.
In this workshop we only touch the surface: you'll observe short, safe examples and experiment with small scripts to gain insight into what scripting can do.

## Examples 
#### Example 1 - Automate mqtt-demo demo.py execution  
To run our simulated weather station we needed to issue the following commands:
* cd ~/mydemo
* source bin/activate
* python3 demo.py
* deactivate

If you are not familiar with Python that command sequence maybe difficult to remember but putting them into a script makes it much easier to start. 

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd ~/mydemo
source bin/activate
python3 demo.py # below is a version of demo.py that contains signal handling
```

import signal  
import sys  
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt  
#broker = "test.mosquitto.org"  
#port = 1883  
broker = "broker.emqx.io"  
port = 1883  
topictemp = f"/lx/sakari/temperature"  
topicpressure = f"/lx/sakari/pressure"  
client = mqtt.Client()  
def signal_handler(sig, frame):   
    print('\nShutting down gracefully...')   
    client.disconnect()  
    sys.exit(0)  
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)  
def publish_temperature():  
    while True:  
        temperature = random.uniform(20.0, 30.0)  
        client.publish(topictemp, f"{temperature:.2f}")  
        print(f"Published: {temperature:.2f} to topic {topictemp}")  
        pressure = random.uniform(1020.0, 1030.0)  
        client.publish(topicpressure, f"{pressure:.2f}")  
        print(f"Published: {pressure:.2f} to topic {topicpressure}")   
        time.sleep(5)  
client.connect(broker, port)  
publish_temperature()
```

### Example 2 - Create a shared directory for a project group 
In our 'files and directories ownership and permissions' workshop, we created shared directories for project groups. If that need arises often, it is a good candidate for automation. It is not difficult to write a quick-and-dirty script to do the work, but let's try using an AI tool to generate interactive versions that accomplish the same task. Our primary goal is to have a reliable, maintainable script, createteamdir --options teamname, that creates a shared directory for a student team named teamname. Depending on the option --default or --confidential, the directory will be either world-readable or restricted.

### Example 3 - Safe Cleaning of a Project Directory with Backup Option  
This example shows how to safely clean out the contents of a given project directory while optionally creating a backup. It avoids accidental data loss by checking for the directory's existence and backing up important files before removal.
