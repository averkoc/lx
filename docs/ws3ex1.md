# Linux Workshop: Users, Groups, and File Permissions

## Overview
In this workshop, you will set up a shared directory that can be accessed by members of a specific group. Only group members will be able to create files in this directory, and access to each file will depend on the permissions set by its ownerâ€”allowing other group members to either read or modify the file.

The workshop begins with creating new user accounts on the server, followed by setting up a group named **labgroup1** and assigning selected users to it. Next, you will create a shared folder on the server and configure it so that it is accessible only to members of **labgroup1**.

Finally, you will create and test files in the shared directory to observe how different permission settings affect collaboration within the group.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Create and manage user accounts on a Linux server.  
- Form groups and configure shared directories with appropriate permissions.  
- Experiment with file-level permissions to understand their impact on collaboration.  
- Recognize how manual user and group management becomes inefficient at scale, and why automation is essential in larger environments such as educational institutes or organizations.  

---

## Tasks

### 1. Create User Accounts
- Log in to the server via SSH.  
- Create at least **five new users** (e.g., `matti1`, `matti2`, `matti3`, `matti4`, `matti5`).  
- Verify that the users have been added correctly.  

### 2. Create and Manage a Group
- Create a new group called **labgroup1**.  
- Add a subset of the new users (e.g., `matti1`, `matti2`, `matti3`) to this group.  
- Verify the group membership with the `groups` command.  

### 3. Create a Shared Directory
- Create a directory **/var/labs** and and directory **group1files** under it.  
- Set the group ownership of group1files to **labgroup1**.  
- Configure directory permissions so that only members of **labgroup1** can create files inside it.  

### 4. Test File Permissions
- As `matti1`, create files inside the shared directory and set permissions for labgroup1 members and others.  
- Test the access rights by switching users and trying to read, write, or create files.

## Verification & Summary
Log in as matti1 and create three files: matti1filea,matti1fileb,matti1filec. Set the files ownerships and permissions in such a way that they are along the permissions presented in the table below. Verify your settings by logging in as matti2/matti3 and matti4/matti5 and observing the effect of permissions.  
**Report your results by submitting the output of command:** `ls -lR /var/labs`.

| filename     | matti1 | matti2 | matti3 | matti4 | matti5 |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| matti1filea  | rw     | r      | r      | r      | r      |
| matti1fileb  | rw     | rw     | rw     | r      | r      |
| matti1filec  | rw     | r      | r      | -      | -      |
| can a user create files in group1files | y | y | y | n | n |

Use this table as part of your report to clearly demonstrate the outcome of your configuration.
