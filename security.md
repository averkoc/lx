# üõ°Ô∏è Defense-in-Depth for Linux Server Hardening

Your Linux workshop demonstrates an **excellent and practical application** of the **Defense-in-Depth** security model, making three crucial layers of protection insightfully observable to students.

The setup effectively separates the roles of **prevention**, **detection/reaction**, and **vulnerability reduction**.

---

## Layer 1: Network Perimeter Control (The Firewall)

| Component | Example Tools | Role | Security Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Firewall** | `iptables`, `firewalld`, `ufw` | **Prevention.** Limits the attack surface by explicitly defining the permissible paths (ports). | **Access Vector Reduction** |
| **Action** | Allows only **SSH (22)** and **HTTP(S) (80/443)**. | This layer stops attacks targeting unauthorized services. |

* **Key Concept:** The firewall addresses the **"OS Open Ports"** attack vector by only exposing *required* ports.

---

## Layer 2: Intrusion Detection & Prevention (IDS/IPS)

| Component | Example Tools | Role | Security Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IDS/IPS/Blocker** | `Fail2ban`, `PortSentry`, Suricata | **Detection & Reaction.** Monitors *allowed* traffic for malicious **attack patterns** and dynamically blocks source IPs. | **Attack Mitigation** |
| **Action** | Observes anomalous behavior, such as a high rate of failed login attempts (**password guessing**), and blocks the attacker's IP. |

* **Key Concept:** This layer is critical because it monitors the traffic passing through the firewall and stops the actual **"SSH Password Guessing" attack**.

---

## Layer 3: Host/Service Hardening (Authentication Policy)

| Component | Example Policy | Role | Security Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | Strong Password Rules (e.g., minimum 16 characters, complexity, no dictionary words). | **Vulnerability Reduction.** Directly addresses the flaw that allows the attack to succeed. | **Vulnerability Remediation** |
| **Action** | Makes a successful brute-force or dictionary attack exponentially less likely, even if the attacker bypasses the IPS temporarily. |

* **Key Concept:** This layer addresses the underlying **vulnerability** introduced by **"SSH Password based authentication"** being configured with poor policy.

---

## Conclusion: Defense-in-Depth Illustrated

Your workshop successfully demonstrates that a single security control is not enough.

| Scenario | Weakness | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| No **Firewall** | Full exposure of all services. | High risk of compromise. |
| No **IDS/IPS** | Attacker can endlessly attempt passwords. | Attack is slow, but persistent. |
| Poor **Passwords** | Single, lucky guess can succeed. | All other layers are bypassed. |

The combined effect of these three independent layers provides **resilience** and is a textbook example of modern security architecture. üíØ

## üõ†Ô∏è Linux Hardening Command Summary

This cheat sheet covers the most essential commands for configuring the **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall) and **Fail2ban** (Intrusion Prevention) layers of protection.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

UFW controls network access to the server, implementing the **Network Perimeter** layer.

| Task | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Install UFW** | `sudo apt install ufw` | Installs the firewall on Debian/Ubuntu systems. |
| **Set Default Policy** | `sudo ufw default deny incoming` | **Crucial:** Denies all incoming traffic unless explicitly allowed. |
| **Allow SSH** | `sudo ufw allow ssh` OR `sudo ufw allow 22/tcp` | Allows necessary SSH access on port 22. |
| **Allow Web** | `sudo ufw allow http` / `sudo ufw allow https` | Allows web traffic on ports 80 and 443. |
| **Allow from Specific IP** | `sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.100 to any port 22 proto tcp` | Restricts SSH access from a specific administration IP source address. |
| **Enable Firewall** | `sudo ufw enable` | **WARNING:** Do this *last* after allowing SSH! |
| **View Status** | `sudo ufw status verbose` | Shows active rules, default policies, and current status. |

---

### üö® Fail2ban (Intrusion Prevention)

Fail2ban monitors logs for attack patterns (like password guessing) and dynamically blocks malicious IPs using the firewall (UFW), implementing the **Detection & Reaction** layer.

| Task | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Install Fail2ban** | `sudo apt install fail2ban` | Installs the Fail2ban package. |
| **Start/Enable** | `sudo systemctl enable --now fail2ban` | Starts the service immediately and ensures it starts on boot. |
| **View Global Status** | `sudo fail2ban-client status` | Lists all active "jails" (services being monitored, like `sshd`). |
| **View Banned IPs** | `sudo fail2ban-client status sshd` | Shows the current list of banned IPs for the SSH service. |
| **Manually Unban** | `sudo fail2ban-client unban <IP_ADDRESS>` | Immediately removes a specified IP address from the ban list. |
| **Tail Logs** | `sudo tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log` | Monitors Fail2ban's activity and bans in real-time. |

**Configuration Reference:**

* The main configuration file is typically `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf`, but you should use **`/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`** for any custom overrides (like changing the `bantime` or `maxretry`) to avoid issues during software updates.
